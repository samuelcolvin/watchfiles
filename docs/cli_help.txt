usage: watchfiles [-h] [--ignore-paths [IGNORE_PATHS]]
                  [--target-type [{command,function,auto}]]
                  [--filter [FILTER]] [--verbosity [{warning,info,debug}]]
                  [--version]
                  paths target ...

Watch one or more directories and execute either a shell command or a python function on file changes.

Example of watching the current directory and calling a python function:

    watchfiles . foobar.main

Example of watching two local directories and calling a shell command:

    watchfiles src,tests pytest -v

positional arguments:
  paths                 Filesystem path to watch, to watch multiple paths use a comma as separator, e.g. "." or "src,tests"
  target                Command or dotted function path to run

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ignore-paths [IGNORE_PATHS]
                        Specify directories to ignore, to ignore multiple paths use a comma as separator, e.g. "env" or "env,node_modules"
  --target-type [{command,function,auto}]
                        Whether the target should be intercepted as a shell command or a python function, defaults to "auto" which infers the target type from the target string
  --filter [FILTER]     Which files to watch, defaults to "default" which uses the "DefaultFilter", "python" uses the "PythonFilter", "all" uses no filter, any other value is interpreted as a python function/class path which is imported
  --verbosity [{warning,info,debug}]
                        Log level, defaults to "info"
  --version, -V         show program's version number and exit
